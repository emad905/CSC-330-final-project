I am happy for you to see this Fifth Edition of Introduction to Linear Algebra.
This is the text for my video lectures on MIT's OpenCourseWare (ocw.mit.edu and
also YouTube). I hope those lectures will be useful to you (maybe even enjoyable!).
Hundreds of coll�ges and universities have chosen this textbook for their basic linear
algebra course. A sabbatical gave me a chance to prepare two new chapters about
probability and statistics and understanding data. Thousands of other improvements tooprobably only noticed by the author. . . Here is a new addition for students and all readers:
Every section opens with a brief summary to explain its contents. When you
read a new section, and when you revisit a section to review and organize
it in your mind, those lines are a quick guide and an aid to memory.
Another big change comes on this book's website math.mit.edu/linearalgebra. That site
now contains solutions to the Problem Sets in the book. With unlimited space, this is
much more flexible than printing short solutions. There are three key websites :
ocw.mit.edu Messages come from thousands of students and faculty about linear algebra
on this OpenCourseWare site. The 18.06 and 18.06 SC courses include video lectures of
a complete semester of classes. Those lectures offer an independent review of the whole
subject based on this textbook-the professor's time stays free and the student's time can
be 2 a.m. (The reader doesn't have to be in a class at all.) Six million viewers around the
world have seen these videos (amazing). I hope you find them helpful.
web.mit.edu/18.06 This site has homeworks and exams (with solutions) for the current
course as it is taught, and as far back as 1996. There are also review questions, Java demos,
Teaching Codes, and short essays (and the video lectures). My goal is to make this book
as useful to you as possible, with all the course material we can provide.
math.mit.edu/linearalgebra This has become an active website. It now has Solutions
to Exercises-with space to explain ideas. There are also new exercises from many different sources-practice problems, development of textbook examples, codes in MATLAB
and Julia and Python, plus whole collections of exams (18.06 and others) for review.

The cover shows the Four Fundamental Subspaces-the row space and nullspace are
on the left side, the column space and the nulls pace of A
T are on the right. It is not usual
to put the central ideas of the subject on display like this! When you meet those four spaces
in Chapter 3, you will understand why that picture is so central to linear algebra.
Those were named the Four Fundamental Subspaces in my first book, and they start
from a matrix A. Each row of A is a vector in n-dimensional space. When the matrix
has m rows, each column is a vector in m-dimensional space. The crucial operation in
linear algebra is to take linear combinations of column vectors. This is exactly the result
of a matrix-vector multiplication. Ax is a combination of the columns of A.
When we take all combinations Ax of the column vectors, we get the column space.
If this space includes the vector b, we can solve the equation Ax = b.
May I call special attention to Section 1.3, where these ideas come early-with two
specific examples. You are not expected to catch every detail of vector spaces in one day!
But you will see the first matrices in the book, and a picture of their column spaces.
There is even an inverse matrix and its connection to calculus. You will be learning the
language of linear algebra in the best and most efficient way: by using it.
Every section of the basic course ends with a large collection of review problems. They
ask you to use the ideas in that section--the dimension of the column space, a basis for
that space, the rank and inverse and determinant and eigenvalues of A. Many problems
look for computations by hand on a small matrix, and they have been highly praised. The
Challenge Problems go a step further, and sometimes deeper. Let me give four examples:
Section 2.1: Which row exchanges of a Sudoku matrix produce another Sudoku matrix?
Section 2.7: If Pis a permutation matrix, why is some power p
k equal to I?
Section 3.4: If Ax= band Cx = b have the same solutions for every b, does A equal C?
Section 4.1: What conditions on the four vectors r, n, c, £ allow them to be bases for
the row space, the nullspace, the column space, and the left nullspace of a 2 by 2 matrix?
The Start of the Course
The equation Ax = b uses the language of linear combinations right away. The vector
Ax is a combination of the columns of A. The equation is asking for a combination that
produces b. The solution vector x comes at three levels and all are important:
1. Direct solution to find x by forward elimination and back substitution.
2. Matrix solution using the inverse matrix: x = A-1
b (if A has an inverse).
3. Particular solution (to Ay = b) plus nullspace solution (to Az = 0).
That vector space solution x = y + z is shown on the cover of the book.The cover shows the Four Fundamental Subspaces-the row space and nullspace are
on the left side, the column space and the nulls pace of A
T are on the right. It is not usual
